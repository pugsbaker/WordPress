roots-child-theme-template
==========================

A child theme template for the roots WordPress theme :: http://www.rootstheme.com/
Keep the roots theme untouched and customize as you see fit.

Things to note :: 

• This child theme assumes that the roots theme is in a folder called 'roots' (in the Wordpress themes folder, of course)
• Change the name of the folder to whatever you want the child theme to be called
• Create a custom menu - the roots menu probably won't be what you want
• If you want to customize any template files just copy them into the child theme directory in the same location and they will override the original.
